# Collecting data for a presentation
Just a tiny little project to download some data from gutindex.com for a presentation.

Justement un petit projét pour télécharger de données de gutindex.com 
pour créer une présentation.

## Requirements
* Python 3.12
* requirements.txt

## Usage
This whole project has such a narrow application that there is hardly any reason 
to provide it with a full-scale description. It has only been published for 
reference. All the functions is located in [gutenberg.py](gutenberg.py) and 
are supplied with comments, although the whole thing seems rather self-explaining.
